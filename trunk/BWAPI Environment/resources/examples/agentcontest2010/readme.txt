First download the agent contest package and extract the archive somewhere (=MASSim-folder):
http://multiagentcontest.org/downloads?func=select&id=16

Then:
1. open a console and goto the MASSim-folder
2. start the server with "sh start2010.sh"
3. open a second console and goto the MASSim-folder
4. start the cow-monitor with "sh startCowMonitor2009.sh"
5. load the MAS-file
6. start your MAS (the agents should connect now)
7. start the simulation by hitting return in the first console
