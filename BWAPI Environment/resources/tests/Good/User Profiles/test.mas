/*
 * This example uses modules for implementing user profiles. It demonstrates the 
 * application of clone module action and plan testing.  
 *
 * The seller module creates the module that represents the buyer's user profile.
 * The seller creates variants of buyer module to find out the private value of 
 * book "Hamlet" by injecting a belief representing selling price into the buyers 
 * belief base and executing his deliberation to see if the buyer decided to buy 
 * the book for the offered price.  
 *
 * The seller checks if the buyer's user profile has adopted the goal to buy the book, 
 * which indicates that the injected belief about the offer was below his private value.
