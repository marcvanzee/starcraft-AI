/*
* Expected behaviour: During the first deliberation step, the first PG-rule
* should be applied for 42, the second rule also for 42, both reactive rules should
* be applied, the fifth rule should be applied for g2(b) and no rule should be
* applied for 44. During the second deliberation step the second rule should be
* applied for 43 and during the third step it should be applied for 44.
